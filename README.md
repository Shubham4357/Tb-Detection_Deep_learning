## Project Overview

This project presents an advanced AI-powered system for detecting tuberculosis (TB) using chest X-ray images. The system leverages state-of-the-art deep learning architectures to provide a two-step analysis:
- First, **lung segmentation** is performed with a U-Net based model to isolate lung regions and reduce noise.
- Then, **TB classification** is performed on these segmented regions using a DenseNet121-based classifier.

The goal is to develop an accurate, explainable, and research-focused AI tool for tuberculosis detection, designed for educational and academic use.

## Project Structure

- `preprocessing.py` — Data loading, cleaning, resizing, normalization, and dataset splitting for both segmentation and classification.
- `segmentation.py` — U-Net model definition, training with data augmentation, cross-validation, and evaluation.
- `classification.py` — DenseNet121 model for TB detection, training with k-fold CV, early stopping, and evaluation.
- `train.py` — Training orchestration, integrating segmentation and classification training workflows.
- `utils.py` — Helper functions for visualization (including Grad-CAM), metrics, and data conversion.
- `webapp/` — Modern Flask-based web UI with image upload, prediction visualization, and interactive results display.

## Key Features

- **Two-stage approach:** Combines lung segmentation with disease classification for improved accuracy.
- **Deep learning architectures:** Utilizes U-Net for segmentation and DenseNet121 for classification.
- **Cross-validation:** Implements k-fold cross-validation for both model training and evaluation to ensure robustness.
- **Data augmentation:** Uses diverse augmentation techniques to enhance model generalization.
- **Explainability:** Integrates Grad-CAM visualizations to highlight important regions influencing the AI’s decisions.
- **Research disclaimer:** Clear indications that the system is for research, educational purposes only and not for clinical use.
- **Modern UI:** User-friendly web application for image upload, results display, and risk visualization.
